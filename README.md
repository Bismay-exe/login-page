# Cartoon Login Page — Static & 3D

Two ready-to-use login pages matching the clean, playful style you wanted.

## Files
- `index-static.html` — Static page with a cartoon SVG illustration (no 3D).
- `index-3d.html` — 3D animated character beside the login form (Three.js).
- `style.css` — Shared styling.
- `assets/cartoon-person.svg` — Illustration for the static version.

## 3D Model
To avoid any downloads, the 3D page references a **public GLB** hosted by the Three.js project:
`RobotExpressive.glb` — includes multiple animations. We briefly play a "greeting" dance then fade to idle.

If you later want a specific cartoon *businessman* model, swap the `MODEL_URL` in `index-3d.html` to your `.glb` file.

## How to use
- Open `index-static.html` for the static version, or
- Open `index-3d.html` for the animated version.

> No build tools required — just open in a modern browser.
